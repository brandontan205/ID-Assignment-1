Valorant website redesign

I wanted to redesign the valorant website, by making it easier to use and not so cluttered

This website is for people who want to get into the game and know the basic stuff of the game, as well as to get support by the support team when needed.

Some user stories are:

As a user, i want to be able to contact support easily, to fix my problem quickly
As a user, i want to be able to quickly understand the background of valorant, so i can play the game

Some Features are:

Navigation bar, able to click to each page that you want
Able to submit a request for help

Technologies used are:

CSS and HTML
Extensions are Prettier, Autosave, Liveserver and ESLint in Visual Studio Code
